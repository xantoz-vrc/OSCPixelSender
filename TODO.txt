Replace FLTK with Iced (what COSMIC uses)?
Other runners would be:
Ribir (looks relatively sane),
Slint (has it's own little DSL, but seems mostly sane)
Relm (GTK),
Egui (immediate mode is a minus)

Consider making the appmessage sender a global variable (use oncelock
or so) so I don't have to pass it around everywhere. That should allow
me to make some nice wrappers around sending AppMessages as well.
Maybe the same for sending messages to the BG thread as well?


Use fltk-builder for a nicer syntax? Also seems like we won't need to
manage our references to widgets then as well, as we have been forced
to do now.

Actually even without fltk-builder we can get widgets using fltk::app::wid
